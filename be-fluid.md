# Be fluid

One of the most important, and most difficult, lessons to learn about building for the web is to learn to think squishy. The variety of devices accessing the web is huge, and they have a wide range of screen sizes and browser capabilities that don't fit into easily classifiable categories. You get devices with small screens that high very high capabilities and processing power (like an iPhone) and you get devices with huge screens that have relatively low capabilites (like the current generation of smart TVs, or browsers on consoles).

Learning to let go of pixel perfection means thinking more in terms of proportions than pixels. Column widths becomes `%`s instead of `px`. Font sizes become `em` instead of `px`. Start to think about content in terms of typographic measure (line length) in `em`s rather than device screen sizes in `px`.

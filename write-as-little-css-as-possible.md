# Write as little CSS as possible

One of the most confusing things working as a Front-end developer is coming to someone else's code and being confronted by huge, complicated, stylesheets. This often rears its head when you've been asked to make "jut this one small change." You struggle to find exactly what is causing the current behaviour, and then can only find an even more complicated way to fix or change it.

It's tricky to fix in that situation (you'd have to refactor sections of code to make it more friendly), but when you're writing your own CSS from scratch, it's a little simpler. Try and avoid complexity by writing reusable modules. Look at the number of rules, and the number of unique colours and font-sizes. These kind of metrics are useful as red flags for having too much complexity or too many lines of code.
